# What is "Fuck Off, Steam?"
This small little program updates the CSS within Steam to hide the "What's New" panel from your library. Only known to work on Windows 10. 

# How to use
Download the repository as a zip file and extract the files to wherever you would like, then right-click the shortcut. Select "Properties." Within the "Target" field, enter `cmd /c start "" folder_path\fuckoffsteam.bat "folder_path\Steam"`. Don't forget to replace each `folder_path` with the path on your machine. Then simply use the shortcut to launch Steam instead, and it will ensure your library does not display the "What's New" panel.
